# gtdf - Generate testing (pandas) DataFrame

This is a module with collection of generating objects useful for development and testing.
The focus is on simplicity (everything does what you expect it to out-of-the-box) and versatility (many different types of data, many parameters).

The main function found in generate_test_data.py is gdf(). This produces a data frame with columns of different types (str, int, datetime, float etc.), which can be created in several copies by changing the n parameter.
